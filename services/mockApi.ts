Climate change represents one of the most pressing economic challenges of our time, with far-reaching implications for global markets, supply chains, and financial systems. The scientific consensus on climate change is overwhelming, with 97% of climate scientists agreeing that human activities are the primary driver of recent warming trends (DOC1:p3). Greenhouse gas concentrations have increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution, with CO2 levels rising from 280 ppm to over 400 ppm, creating unprecedented environmental and economic pressures (DOC1:p7).

Effective policy responses to climate change require comprehensive approaches that address both mitigation and adaptation strategies. Carbon pricing mechanisms include carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems, both designed to internalize the external costs of carbon emissions and incentivize cleaner technologies (NOTES1:chunk2). Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels in recent years, offering viable alternatives for sustainable economic growth (NOTES2:chunk1).

International cooperation is essential for addressing the global nature of climate change and ensuring coordinated policy responses. The Paris Agreement represents a landmark international effort to limit global temperature rise to well below 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels, demonstrating the potential for multilateral environmental governance (REF1:p2).

Adaptation strategies for climate change include infrastructure improvements, agricultural modifications, and coastal protection measures that can help societies prepare for inevitable climate impacts (REF2:p5). These strategies require significant investment but can reduce long-term economic costs and improve resilience.

In conclusion, addressing climate change requires a multifaceted approach that combines immediate policy action, international cooperation, and long-term adaptation strategies. The economic costs of inaction far exceed the investments needed for mitigation and adaptation, making climate action not just an environmental imperative but an economic necessity.`;
